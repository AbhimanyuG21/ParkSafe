# ParkSafe

ParkSafe is web based application that uses node and express as the backend technologies with mongodb as the database and simple html,css, bootstrap, javascript
as the frontend technologies. The application consists of a simple UI, being not very proficient in the frontend technologies, instead focussing on the backend design
logic and security of data that is being submitted by the users. A certain oauth api has been used to protect user data  during login and registration processes while
the nosql document structure is created to focus on storing only the necessary information while being stored in a consistent mannner with redundancy being removed.
Dummy data is being used for the booking component of parking tickets which more than showcases of how the application is meant to work. Further, dynamic routing and
other such techniques and convention are being used to reduce the time it takes for loading resources. There is still a lot more that could be improved on it and I am open
to feedback.

The project has also been deployed using heroku and can be found at https://park-safe-app.herokuapp.com/
